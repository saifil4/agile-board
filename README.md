This is an effort to build a kanban board using React.

You can do the following.
1. Drag and drop tasks into different lanes.
2. Add new task or update a existing one.
3. You can click on the top right button to access labels and filter tasks by label.
4. You can also create a new label and assign that label to an existing or new task.
5. You can search for tasks by name.

After you have forked the project you have to run `npm install` to install all dependencies and following that run `npm start` to start a live server.
